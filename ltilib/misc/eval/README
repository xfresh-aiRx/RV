This directory contains functors or data structures used in the
evaluation of algorithms.  They are not part of the main library,
since evaluation is a step you usually want "outside" the real
applications.

At this point this directory contains the lti::paretoFront functor and
derived classes.

Since wether the Makefile for Linux/GCC nor the Project files for
Windows/VC++ consider this directory, you have to copy or link them to
you working directory.  For example, for the Linux "tester" framework
you can just link them to the linux/workbench directory.
