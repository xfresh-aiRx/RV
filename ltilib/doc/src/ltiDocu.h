\section intro Introduction

The term LTI-Lib encloses a collection of algorithms and data
structures commonly used in image processing and computer vision
applications.  It is written in C++ in order to allow efficient
programming techniques using an object-oriented approach.

Its main goal is to provide a system independent library, which
follows as much as possible the ANSI C++ standards.  It works on
different <a href="http://www.unix.org">Unix</a> platforms and on 
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows">Microsoft's Windows</a>, but
it is specially maintained for <a href="http://www.linux.org">Linux</a> /
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/gcc/gcc.html">GCC</a> and 
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/ntworkstation/default.asp">Windows NT</a> / 
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/visualc">MS Visual C++</a>.

The LTI-Lib was created at the 
<a href="http://www.techinfo.rwth-aachen.de/index_e.html">Chair of
Technical Computer Science</a> at the 
<a href="http://www.rwth-aachen.de/zentral/aguid_english_default.htm">RWTH
Aachen University</a>.  It is the result of several years of research in
several difficult computer vision problems like visual object recognition,
vision for mobile service robots and gesture recognition.

These pages give some introductory information about how to use the
LTI-Lib.  The conditions of use for the LTI-Lib are given in \ref license.
Some important concepts necessary to understand the
library are shown in \ref architecture.
The section \ref classHierarchy presents a thematic organization of
many classes found in this library.  Using the links shown on the top
of this page you can browse the on-line programming reference.

Other useful information can be reached through the links in \ref contents
and in our <a href="../homepage/index.html">homepage</a>.
