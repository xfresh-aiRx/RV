<dt><a href="http://www.techinfo.rwth-aachen.de/Forschung/VIR/index_e.html">
    Visual Information Retrieval at LTI</a> 
<dd>Research in this group deals with machine vision and its application to
    visual information retrieval.  The main research topics are object 
    recognition and pose estimation, for which almost exclusivelly the LTI-Lib
    image processing and general classification and clustering methods are 
    used.
<dt><a href="http://www.techinfo.rwth-aachen.de/Forschung/SLR/index_e.html">
    Sign Language Recognition at LTI</a>
<dd>Sign languages are visual languages used by many deaf people all over the
    world.  Teaching computers to recognize this language is the main research
    topic of this group.  The LTI-Lib provides the required image processing
    tools and the Hidden-Markov-Models classifiers used for the recognition.
<dt><a href="http://www.techinfo.rwth-aachen.de/Forschung/MSR/index_e.html">
    Mobile Service Robots at LTI</a>
<dd>The research of the robotics group at the Chair of Technical Computer
    Science (LTI) concentrates on topics like robot simulation in distributed
    virtual environments, mobile manipulation based on teach-in in virtual
    environments, assisted wheelchair to support physically handicapped people,
    RoboCup, and much more.
    The LTI-Lib provides the necessary framework for image processing and
    image acquisition.
<dt><a href="http://www.montefiore.ulg.ac.be/Welcome-en.html">Computer Vision
    Group at ULg</a>
<dd>University of Liege, Belgium, Department of Electrical Engineering and
    Computer Science (Montefiore Institute), Group of Computer Vision and
    Signal Processing.  Research in computer vision, machine learning, medical
    imaging, radar imaging. They have been using the LTI-Lib for student
    projects (imaging, computer vision) since mid 2003, and also use it in
    research activities (sports video analysis, visual feature learning).
