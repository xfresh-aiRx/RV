Directory ltilib/win

This directory contains several projects to build the LTI-Lib or
applications that use it.  The subdirectories contain following
projects.

- batchFiles    Empty directory, where other projects might store
                temporary batch files.
- buildLib      Project consisting of a batch file and some PERL
                scripts.  Just run the buildLib.bat file to compile
                the LTI-Lib.  The results will be left in the
                ltilib/lib directory and all object files will be
                left in the ltilib/obj directory.
- console_src   Contains a PERL script that builds MS Visual C++
                project files console_src.dsp and console_src.dsw.
                This project compiles each LTI-Lib source file and
                link it with the console_src.cpp file.  No library
                is build.  You can use it to debug LTI-Lib classes.
- console_lib   Contains a PERL script that builds MS Visual C++
                project files console_lib.dsp and console_lib.dsww.
                This project compiles the console_lib.cpp file and
                links it to a previously compiled library.  The
                buildLib.bat file in buildLib directory must be 
                executed previously.
- tester        Very similar to the console_src project, but ready
                to link it with the main.cpp and ltiTester.cpp files
                in ltilib/tester.
