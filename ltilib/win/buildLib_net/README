Building the LTI-Lib binaries with Visual Studio .NET

- Prerequisites:
  * installed Visual Studio .NET 2003 Professional
  * installed Perl interpreter
  * installed CVS (optional)

- configure buildLib.net.bat:
  * you have to change settings in the configuration section of the script to
    make it work as you wish, see the script itself for the details
  
- run buildLib.net.bat:
  * call buildLib.net.bat with -help option to see availabe command line options
  * a call without options will do the following:
    - new sources are NOT checked out (use -co to do so)
    - all header files of the ltilib are collected and copied to ltilib\lib\headerfiles
    - an update build for all configurations is performed
