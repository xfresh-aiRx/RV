The LTI-Lib is an object oriented library with algorithms and data
structures frequently used in image processing and computer vision.
It has been developed at the Chair of Technical Computer Science
(Lehrstuhl fuer Technische Informatik) LTI at the RWTH-Aachen
University, as part of many research projects in computer vision
dealing with robotics, object recognition and sing language and
gesture recognition.

The main goal of the LTI-Lib is to provide an object oriented
library in C++, which simplifies the code sharing and maintenance, but
still providing fast algorithms that can be used in real applications.

Functors based on the SUSAN algorithms.

  A UK pantent has been granted for these algorithms:

  * "Method for digitally processing images to determine the position
  * of edges and/or corners therein for guidance of unmanned vehicle",
  * UK Patent 2272285. Proprietor: Secretary of State for Defence,
  * UK. 15 January 1997

  For this reason the code using them cannot be released under the LGPL
  License.  You can use the files under the original SUSAN-Code
  conditions:
