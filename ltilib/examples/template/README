If you create a new example, just copy the Makefile in this directory
into the new example directory.

If there is no Makefile here, it still needs to be created by calling
"./configure" in the ltilib/linux directory.

You can use the Makefile for your own proyects, if you replace the
LTICMD from lti-local-config to lti-config.  This will work only if
you already installed the library (see ltilib/linux/README)
