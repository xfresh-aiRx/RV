This is a little tool for converting bitmaps into EPS files. It can
convert bitmaps of type BMP, JPEG, or PNG into EPS files (either color
or grayscale). 

<h3>Usage</h3>

You can simply call it by<br>
<tt>
   bitmap2eps [-c <i>coding_type</i>] [-t <i>type</i>] [-o <i>output_file</i>] <i>filename</i>
</tt>

<p>
<dl>
<dt><i>filename</i></dt>
<dd>is the name of the bitmap file.</dd>
<p>

<dt><i>coding_type</i></dt>
<dd>
is one of:
<ul>
<li><tt>hex</tt><br>
means that the bitmap data is encoded as hexadecimal
digits. This coding requires a lot of space, but it is very readable
for humans.
</li>
<li><tt>asc85</tt><br>
encodes the bitmap data to a range of 85
characters. It uses about 30% less space than the <tt>hex</tt> coding,
but is not as readable.
</li>
<li><tt>runlength</tt><br>
first compresses the bitmap by a runlength
coding method. It is useful mostly for gray-scale images that contain
large homogeneous areas. It should not be used for color images since
the R, G, and B channels are interleaved, so that runlength coding is
ineffective.
</li>
<li><tt>jpeg</tt><br>
uses the JPEG compression facility built into the
PostScript Level 2 standard. It uses a lossy compression technique, but the
quality is sufficient for most applications.
</li>
<li><tt>deflate</tt><br>
uses the deflate compression algorithm (same as in gzip). The
corresponding decompression method is part of the PostScript Level 3
standard, which is not implemented by most current printers. This is a
lossless compression method.
</li>
</ul>
The default value is <tt>asc85</tt>.
</dd>

<p>
<dt><i>type</i></dt>

<dd>is the type of the resulting EPS file:
<ul>
<li><tt>rgb</tt><br> creates an RGB color EPS file.
</li>
<li><tt>gray</tt><br> creates a grayscale EPS file. Use this for creating
files that are printed on grayscale printers - It saves a lot of space
for the uncompressed codings.
</li>
</ul>
The default is <tt>rgb</tt>.
</dd>

<p>
<dt><i>output_file</i></dt>
<dd>overrides the name of the output file. The default
output filename is the name of the source file with its extension
replaced by ".eps".</dd>
</dl>

<h3>Errors</h3>

There are two possible sources of errors:
<ul>
<li>The file does not exist, or does not end in ".png", ".bmp", or
".jpg". The resulting error message is "Invalid parameters".
</li>
<li>There is something wrong with the image file. The resulting error
message should describe the problem.
</li>
</ul>
